For User:

This is a dynamic form project. It can make a CSV file into a web form and a database table and can store the data from the form to that database table.

It can't transform any CSV file to those things I said. You have to write the CSV file in a structured way. You have to learn the database syntax to write the file. 

CSV file format.
In every row, there must be five columns.

Syntax: Table_name,Dress,select,"Dress: Shirt Pants",VARCHAR(100),

1.Database Table name(Only for first row).

2. Database table name and it would appear on the form as text name.

3. It is the type of text box. It would determine what kind of data you can be able to enter.

4. It's not for every kind of form type. It is for the radio button or select box or check box. 

5. Database table's column data type. (To know what it is, you have to Google).

For developer:

The test file is the backbone of this project. Break it and you don't have a project. To fix it you have to research every bit of information you have on the internet. And which is nothing. 

This file is reading the CSV files and breaking them into pieces and making them accessible for testForm file to make a dynamic form.

testForm file makes the form and stores the data into a database table.

table file is making the database table.

choose file is choosing the CSV file. And chooseNumber is choosing the file number from the folder.

There's a lot of explanation inside these files. Read those and if you can't understand, don't worry I also don't understand them. It works. And that is the real deal.
